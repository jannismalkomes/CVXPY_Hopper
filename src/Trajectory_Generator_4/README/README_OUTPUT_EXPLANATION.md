## üéØ **Section 1: Objective Value**
```
obj = 5.239477
```
**What it means**: The optimal objective value (logarithm of final spacecraft mass)
- **Physical interpretation**: `final_mass = exp(5.239477) = 187.31 kg`
- **Fuel consumption**: `200kg - 187.31kg = 12.69 kg` of fuel used
- **Optimization goal**: Maximize final mass (minimize fuel consumption)

---

## üìä **Section 2: Mass Trajectory (100 values)**
```
log_mass[0] = 5.298317  # t=0.0s:  exp(5.298317) = 200.00 kg (initial mass)
log_mass[1] = 5.297799  # t=0.12s: exp(5.297799) = 199.90 kg
...
log_mass[99] = 5.239477 # t=12.0s: exp(5.239477) = 187.31 kg (final mass)
```
**What it means**: Spacecraft mass decrease over time due to fuel consumption
- **Units**: Natural logarithm of mass [ln(kg)]
- **Trend**: Monotonically decreasing (mass can only decrease)
- **Rate**: Faster decrease = higher thrust = more fuel burn
- **Physics**: Mass decreases as fuel is expelled for thrust

## üöÄ **Section 3: State Trajectory (600 values)**
**Format**: 6 states √ó 100 time steps = 600 values
```
state[0-5]:   Position [x,y,z] and Velocity [vx,vy,vz] at t=0.0s
state[6-11]:  Position [x,y,z] and Velocity [vx,vy,vz] at t=0.12s
...
state[594-599]: Position [x,y,z] and Velocity [vx,vy,vz] at t=12.0s
```

### State Vector Structure (every 6 values):
- **state[6k+0]**: X position [m] (horizontal)
- **state[6k+1]**: Y position [m] (horizontal) 
- **state[6k+2]**: Z position [m] (altitude above ground)
- **state[6k+3]**: X velocity [m/s] (horizontal)
- **state[6k+4]**: Y velocity [m/s] (horizontal)
- **state[6k+5]**: Z velocity [m/s] (vertical, negative = downward)

### Key Observations:
```
t=0.0s:  [0, 0, 5.00] m,  [0, 0,  0.00] m/s  # Start: 5m altitude, at rest
t=6.0s:  [0, 0, 1.46] m,  [0, 0, -0.35] m/s  # Midpoint: descending slowly
t=12.0s: [0, 0, 0.00] m,  [0, 0,  0.00] m/s  # End: ground level, at rest
```

## ‚ö° **Section 4: Control Trajectory (300 values)**
**Format**: 3 thrust components √ó 100 time steps = 300 values
```
control[0-2]:   Thrust [Fx, Fy, Fz] at t=0.0s
control[3-5]:   Thrust [Fx, Fy, Fz] at t=0.12s
...
control[297-299]: Thrust [Fx, Fy, Fz] at t=12.0s
```

### Control Vector Structure (every 3 values):
- **control[3k+0]**: X thrust [N] (horizontal force)
- **control[3k+1]**: Y thrust [N] (horizontal force)
- **control[3k+2]**: Z thrust [N] (vertical force, positive = upward)

### Thrust Profile Analysis:
```
t=0.0s:  [0, 0, 8.95] N   # Initial: pure vertical thrust
t=6.0s:  [0, 0, 9.80] N   # Mid-flight: slightly higher thrust
t=12.0s: [0, 0, 8.23] N   # Landing: reduced thrust for soft touchdown
```

**Physical Insights**:
- **Horizontal thrust**: All zero (no horizontal movement needed)
- **Vertical thrust**: Varies to counteract gravity and control descent
- **Thrust range**: 8-10 N (reasonable for 200kg spacecraft)

## üîß **Section 5: Thrust Slack Variables (100 values)**
```
thrust_slack[0] = 8.945499   # t=0.0s
thrust_slack[1] = 8.154724   # t=0.12s
...
thrust_slack[99] = 9.293027  # t=12.0s
```
**What it means**: Internal optimization variables for thrust magnitude constraints
- **Purpose**: Enforce thrust limits and convexify the problem
- **Relationship**: `thrust_slack[k] ‚âà ||control[3k:3k+2]||` (thrust magnitude)
- **Constraints**: Must satisfy `r1/m_wet ‚â§ thrust_slack ‚â§ r2/m_dry`
- **Units**: Newtons [N]

## üßÆ **Section 6: Dual Variables (d0 through d1003)**
These are Lagrange multipliers for the optimization constraints:

### Key Dual Variable Categories:
- **d0-d5**: Initial/final condition constraints
- **d6-d11**: Boundary conditions (position/velocity)
- **d12-d500**: Dynamics constraints (equations of motion)
- **d501-d800**: Thrust magnitude constraints
- **d801-d1003**: Mass constraints and bounds

**Physical Meaning**:
- **Zero values**: Constraint is not active (not limiting the solution)
- **Non-zero values**: Constraint is active (limiting the optimal solution)
- **Large values**: Strong constraint influence on the solution

## üîç **How to Interpret the Data**

### 1. **Verify Mass Conservation**:
```python
initial_mass = exp(log_mass[0])   # Should be 200kg
final_mass = exp(log_mass[99])    # Should be 187.31kg
fuel_used = initial_mass - final_mass  # Should be 12.69kg
```

### 2. **Check Trajectory Feasibility**:
```python
# Position should start at [0,0,5] and end at [0,0,0]
initial_pos = [state[0], state[1], state[2]]     # [0,0,5]
final_pos = [state[594], state[595], state[596]] # [0,0,0]
```

### 3. **Analyze Thrust Profile**:
```python
# Extract vertical thrust at each time step
thrust_z = [control[3*k+2] for k in range(100)]
# Should be positive (counteracting gravity)
```

### 4. **Validate Physics**:
- Mass trajectory: Monotonically decreasing ‚úì
- Altitude trajectory: Starts at 5m, ends at 0m ‚úì
- Velocity trajectory: Starts and ends at zero ‚úì
- Thrust profile: Always upward (positive Z) ‚úì
